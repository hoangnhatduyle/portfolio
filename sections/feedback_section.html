                            that were able to allow us to better understand where our business stands with not only
                            target dates, but also easily view planned to actual data side by side. He did this, while
                            creating convenient and creative ways to input data easily.</p>

                            <div>We have been having a great experience working with Le since his first co-op with us.
                                Very sharp, and always looking to take on new tasks and learn new things. Great guy, and
                                I cannot recommend him highly enough!</div>

                            <div>One of the many positive traits that Le has, is his ability to take what we have as a
                                vision for a project and turn it into reality. He created a few dashboards that were
                                able to allow us to better understand where our business stands with not only target
                                dates, but also easily view planned to actual data side by side. He did this, while
                                creating convenient and creative ways to input data easily.</div>

                    Intel 80x86 Assembly Language. The program will first take in radices for input, perform basic
                    operations and output the results in radix from 2 (binary) to 62.
                    Once it is complete, it will prompt the user if they wish to repeat. In addition, none of the
                    Irvine32 functions are to be used, since all the procedures were manually rewritten (reading the
                    input/converting it to a usable value).

                        Compression</span>Huffman coding (also known as Huffman Encoding) is an algorithm for doing data
                    compression, and it forms the basic idea behind file compression. The idea is to use
                    “variable-length encoding”. It
                    is due to the fact that some characters occur more frequently than others in a text to design an
                    algorithm that can represent the same piece of text using a lesser number of bits. We can then
                    reference to the Huffman tree to decode
                    any given string of characters.

                    extremely dangerous epidemic that negatively influences enormous aspects of the world. One of the
                    optimistic solutions is the launch of diverse COVID-19 vaccines in order
                    to prevent the spread of the epidemic. Our study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of the
                    COVID-19 vaccine among different world regions. The data has drawn conclusions about the efficieny
                    of vaccines in mitigating the number
                    of infections, spread, and deaths for vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. </p>

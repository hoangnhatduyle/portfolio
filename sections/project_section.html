                <p class="project-description"><span class="card-title">Radix Project</span> Radix project is written in Intel 80x86 Assembly Language. The program will first take in radices for input, perform basic operations and output the results in radix from 2 (binary) to 62.
                    Once it is complete, it will prompt the user if they wish to repeat. In addition, none of the Irvine32 functions are to be used, since all the procedures were manually rewritten (reading the input/converting it to a usable value).

                                        Compression</span>Huffman coding (also known as Huffman Encoding) is an algorithm for doing data compression, and it forms the basic idea behind file compression. The idea is to use “variable-length encoding”. It
                    is due to the fact that some characters occur more frequently than others in a text to design an algorithm that can represent the same piece of text using a lesser number of bits. We can then reference to the Huffman tree to decode
                    any given string of characters.

                    to prevent the spread of the epidemic. Our study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine among different world regions. The data has drawn conclusions about the efficieny of vaccines in mitigating the number
                    of infections, spread, and deaths for vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. </p>
